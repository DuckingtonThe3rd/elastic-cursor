# Elastic Cursor
Pretty self explanatory.
It's a circle which follows your cursor around, rotates and squeezes based on your cursor movement. You can implement it on any of your projects simply by creating a division `circle` and adding these files, sourcing them from `script.js` and `style.css`, like so.
```html
<html lang="en" >
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Your Title here</title>
    <!--Your Other Code here-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

</head>
<body>
    <!--Your Other Code here-->
<div class="circle"></div>
  <script  src="./script.js"></script>

</body>
</html>

```
